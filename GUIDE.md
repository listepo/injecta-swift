# Injecta guide

Injecta is compile-time dependency injection for Swift 6. You declare a container once with
`@Container`, mark the types it builds `@Injectable`, and read entries as properties. The macros
write the wiring as plain initializer calls, so a resolve is a property read: no registry, no
dictionary, no lock and no task-local lookup on the hot path. A missing entry, a dependency cycle
or a misuse is a compile error at the line that causes it.

## Quick start

```swift
import Injecta

@Injectable
final class Database: Sendable {
  init(config: Config, logger: any Logger) { ... }
}

@Injectable
struct UserRepo: Sendable {
  let db: Database
  let logger: any Logger
}

@Container
final class AppGraph: Sendable {
  let config: Config                                   // input: an init parameter
  @Provides(.singleton) func makeLogger() -> any Logger { ConsoleLogger() }
  @Singleton var db: Database                          // built once, on first read
  @Transient var repo: UserRepo                        // built on every read
}

let graph = AppGraph(config: Config())
let repo = graph.repo
```

Add the build-tool plugin to the target that declares the container (see "The plugin"). It
generates one line per auto-wired type, `extension AppGraph: Database.Needs {}`, and checks the
whole graph across files.

## Entries

Every member of a `@Container` class is an entry, named by its property name.

| Declaration | Lifetime | Built from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `let name: Type` (no value) | input | a parameter of the generated `init` |
| `let name = value` or a computed `var` | input | your code, as written |
| `@Singleton var name: Type` | one per container, on first read | `Type`'s `@Injectable` initializer |
| `@Singleton(.eager) var name: Type` | one per container, in `init` | the same |
| `@Transient var name: Type` | new on every read | the same |
| `@Provides(.singleton) func makeName(a: A) -> Type` | one per container | your function |
| `@Provides(.eagerSingleton) func makeName(...) -> Type` | one per container, in `init` | your function |
| `@Provides(.transient) func makeName(...) -> Type` | new on every read | your function |
| `@Forward var name: Type` | the parent's | `parent.name` |

Rules:

- A provider is named `make` + the entry name: `makeCore` provides `core`.
- A provider's argument labels are entry names. `func makeCore(home: String)` reads `home`.
- Use a provider for protocol types (`any Logger`), types from other modules, generic types, and
  anything that needs custom construction. `@Singleton`/`@Transient` take only concrete
  `@Injectable` types.
- Providers and injected initializers cannot `throw` or be `async`. Build such values before the
  container and pass them in as inputs.
- A `Lazy<T>` or `() -> T` parameter (also `@Sendable () -> T`) names the entry of type `T` and
  reads it later. See "Lazy and factories".

## Injectable types

`@Injectable` lets a container build the type. It picks the initializer marked `@Inject`, else the
only initializer, else a struct's memberwise initializer. Every argument label without a default
value is an entry the container must provide under that name; defaulted arguments keep their
defaults.

```swift
@MainActor
@Injectable
final class SettingsStore {
  @Inject init(client: any SettingsClient, secrets: any SecretStore, cwd: String) { ... }
  init(preview: Void) { ... }  // not used by the container
}
```

The macro generates a nested `Needs` protocol (one `var` per label), `init(injecting:)`, and
`injectaDependencies` (the labels that are edges) plus `injectaDeferred` (the labels read later).
Generic types cannot be `@Injectable`; wire them with a provider.

## Scopes

A scope is a child container. It takes the parent as the input `parent`, forwards what it shares
with `@Forward`, and owns its own singletons, which live as long as the child.

```swift
@MainActor
@Container
final class SessionGraph {
  let parent: AppGraph
  let session: any SessionClient       // the value this scope exists for
  @Forward var secrets: any SecretStore
  @Singleton var store: SessionStore   // one per session
}

let scope = SessionGraph(parent: app, session: client)
```

The parent never sees the child's entries, so an app-wide singleton cannot depend on a
per-session value: that mistake has no syntax.

## Lazy and factories

A singleton that takes a transient keeps that one instance for the container's life (a captive
dependency, reported as a warning). A cycle has the same shape: each value needs the other before
either exists. Both are fixed by reading the dependency later.

```swift
@Injectable
final class Cache: Sendable {
  let clock: @Sendable () -> Clock          // a new Clock each call
  init(clock: @escaping @Sendable () -> Clock) { self.clock = clock }
}

@Injectable
final class Left: Sendable {
  let right: Lazy<Right>                    // one Right, on first `.value`
  init(right: Lazy<Right>) { self.right = right }
}

@Injectable
final class Right: Sendable {
  let left: Left
  init(left: Left) { self.left = left }
}

@Container
final class AppGraph: Sendable {
  let counter: Counter
  @Transient var clock: Clock
  @Singleton var cache: Cache               // no captive warning
  @Singleton var left: Left                 // no cycle
  @Singleton var right: Right
}
```

`() -> T` and `Lazy<T>` are not edges. The entry named by the label must still exist, and a test
sees it on the graph as `~clock` (`cache: Cache [singleton] <- ~clock`). A provider parameter of
either shape is wrapped the same way: `func makeCache(clock: @escaping @Sendable () -> Clock)` is
called with a closure that reads `self.clock`.

`Lazy.value` and the factory closure run the entry's normal resolution, so a transient factory
builds a new value per call and a singleton factory returns the shared one. Do not read `.value`
or call the factory from the initializer that just received it: the singleton cell is still being
filled, and the read waits on the same lock.

## Overrides for tests and previews

Every container has an `Overrides` struct with one optional field per singleton and transient.

```swift
var overrides = AppGraph.Overrides()
overrides.logger = SilentLogger()          // a singleton: the value from the start
overrides.repo = { UserRepo.fixture() }    // a transient: called instead of the provider
let graph = AppGraph(config: .test, overrides: overrides)
```

A singleton override is stored in the cell during `init`, so it costs nothing on the resolve path
and the real provider never runs. Use the same container type in tests and previews; do not write
a second container for tests.

## Swift concurrency

- A container whose entries are all `Sendable` can be `final class AppGraph: Sendable` and used
  from any isolation. Singletons are built once even when many tasks read them first at the same
  time.
- A container that builds `@MainActor` types (SwiftUI models) must itself be `@MainActor`. Its
  `Needs` conformances are isolated conformances (`extension UIGraph: @MainActor Model.Needs`),
  generated for you by the plugin. Its `Overrides` closures are main-actor closures.
- The macros recognise a global actor by the `Actor` suffix of the attribute (`@MainActor`).

## The plugin

`InjectaCheckPlugin` runs `injecta-check` on the target's Swift files before they compile. It:

1. generates the `Needs` conformance of every auto-wired type (a macro may only add conformances it
   declares up front, so `@Container` cannot add them itself);
2. reports, at the entry's line, a missing entry or a cycle that runs through `@Injectable` types
   in other files, and a singleton that captures a transient (warning).

SwiftPM:

```swift
.package(path: "../injecta-swift"),
.target(
  name: "App",
  dependencies: [.product(name: "Injecta", package: "injecta-swift")],
  plugins: [.plugin(name: "InjectaCheckPlugin", package: "injecta-swift")]
)
```

Xcode: add the package, then the target's Build Phases → Run Build Tool Plug-ins →
`InjectaCheckPlugin`. Without the plugin, write the conformance lines yourself, one per auto-wired
type; the compiler then reports a missing entry as "does not conform to protocol `Needs`".

## Compile-time errors

| You see | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'x' needs 'y', but the container has no entry named 'y'` | an initializer or provider reads `y` | add an input `let y: T`, a provider `makeY`, or `@Singleton var y: T` |
| `dependency cycle: a -> b -> a` | the entries need each other | move the shared part into a third entry both depend on |
| `singleton 'a' captures transient 'b'` (warning) | `a` keeps one `b` forever | make `b` a singleton, make `a` transient, or depend on `() -> b` or `Lazy<b>` |
| `'any P' cannot be auto-wired` | protocol, optional, generic or function type on `@Singleton`/`@Transient` | use `@Provides(.singleton) func makeX(...) -> any P` |
| `@Singleton is for var entries; a function is a provider` | `@Singleton func ...` | `@Provides(.singleton) func makeX(...)` |
| `this type has N initializers; mark the one the container calls with @Inject` | ambiguous initializer | put `@Inject` on one |
| `an injected parameter needs an argument label` | `init(_ x: X)` | give it a label; the label is the entry name |
| `@Forward reads parent.x; declare the parent container as an input` | no `let parent` | add `let parent: ParentGraph` |
| `does not conform to protocol 'Needs'` | the plugin is not attached (or the entry is missing) | attach `InjectaCheckPlugin`, or add the entry |

## Introspection

`AppGraph.injectaGraph` lists every entry, its lifetime and what it needs.

```swift
#expect(AppGraph.injectaGraph.issues().isEmpty)   // one test catches what the plugin would
print(AppGraph.injectaGraph.describe())           // "db: Database [singleton] <- config, logger"
let dot = AppGraph.injectaGraph.dot()             // Graphviz
```

## Extension points

Injecta is a set of small parts; each can be used or replaced on its own.

- `InjectaGraph`: the graph model and the checks (missing, cycle, captive), with no dependencies.
  Use it for your own tooling or to check a hand-written container.
- `Once<Value>`: the singleton cell (an acquire load on the hot path). A hand-written computed
  property in a container is an entry like any other, so you can replace any generated entry with
  your own code, cached with `Once` or not.
- `injecta-check`: also a command-line tool (`injecta-check OUT.swift FILES...`) for build systems
  other than SwiftPM and Xcode.
- `InjectaSyntax`: the reader that turns declarations into the model, shared by the macros and the
  checker, so both apply the same rules. The macro target compiles the same files through a
  symlink (`Sources/InjectaMacros/Reader`).

## Performance

A singleton read is one acquiring atomic load and a field read. A transient read is the
initializer call plus an override check (a load and a branch). There is no type-keyed registry,
no lock after the first build, and no task-local or dictionary lookup. See `Benchmarks/` for the
comparison with hand-written wiring, swift-dependencies, Factory, Swinject and Resolver, and
README.md for the measured numbers.

## Anti-patterns

- Passing the container into a service. Inject the entries the service needs instead.
- Registering one type twice. Give each entry its own name; names are the keys.
- Writing a second container type for tests. Use `Overrides`.
- Reading a container from a global. Create it at the composition root (the `App` struct) and pass
  entries down; for SwiftUI, put the models it builds into the environment.
- Silencing a missing entry with a default value or an optional. Add the entry.

## Limits

- Providers and injected initializers are synchronous and non-throwing.
- `@Injectable` does not support generic types; containers cannot be generic.
- Names, not types, connect entries: two entries of one type are fine, but a label must match an
  entry name exactly.
- A cycle that goes through a hand-written computed property is not visible to the checks.
